          <p>Currenct Circulating Supply : 120.3 million</p>
          <p>Ethereum is a decentralized computing platform that uses ETH (also called Ether) to pay transaction fees (or “gas”).
            Developers can use Ethereum to run decentralized applications (dApps) and issue new crypto assets, known as Ethereum tokens.</p>

					<h2>Cardano</h2>
					<p>Currenct Circulating Supply : 1.0 Billion</p>
					<p>Cardano (ADA) is a blockchain platform built on a proof-of-stake consensus protocol (called Ouroboros) that validates transactions without high energy costs.
						Development on Cardano uses the Haskell programming language, which is described as enabling Cardano “to pursue evidence-based development for unparalleled security and stability.”
						The blockchain’s native token, ADA, is named after the 19th century mathematician, Ada Lovelace.</p>

					<p>Solana is a decentralized computing platform that uses SOL to pay for transactions.
						Solana aims to improve blockchain scalability by using a combination of proof of stake consensus and so-called proof of history.
						As a result, Solana claims to be able to support 50,000 transactions per second without sacrificing decentralization.
