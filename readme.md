**CTEC3905 Crypto.com**


 This is a website about latest trends in crypto currencies and exchanges. It have big potential in building or creating society where awareness about cryptocurrency is less available.
 In future this website can be used to read news or latest buying trends on blockchain technology.  
 As everyday new currencies and exchanges being launched, keeping up with new technology have become far more challenging and difficult but this website can be used to teach kids and elderly who doesn't understand the crypto market or ongoing changes in financial system.
 blockchain adoption by big banks and financial institutions is becoming more common day by day but on the other hand governments doesn't pay that much of attention in teaching about such technology.
 In this website people can look for crypto which are in trends.
How this exchanges work would be next part of this website or how payment and smart contract works in real world.
People can also contact me or for more info or ask questions about these technology.
